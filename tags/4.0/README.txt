With the ShareThis widget, users can send blog posts, text, and pictures to others in their network via many social networking and social media options, as well as email, SMS/text message, and AIM. 

Whether posting to Facebook or MySpace, tweeting via Twitter, Digging it or Sharing to Google Buzz, users can make the most of the content on blogs through a single widget with a wealth of options.

== Recent Feature Updates ==

At ShareThis we are always trying to develop a sharing product with our users and publishers needs in mind. Through our support forums, outreach on social media sites and personal experiences, we continue to cultivate the widget and sharing experience to include features and functionalities that we hope you like. 

In the most recent update we have some great features to share:
-	More choices & flexibility in layout and styling of social sharing buttons on your page. Visit the new ShareThis Options page in your WordPress admin area to learn more.
- 	Visual customization of sharing buttons through your CSS stylesheet. This means you control the look & feel of these buttons in your own domain.
-	Native look and usage of the new Twitter button and Facebook button.

Simply put, Social Reach measures how popular a story is with users by counting outbound sharing and inbound visits from friends on social networks for these shared links. A number is displayed on your pages. See example screenshots in the update documentation.
- 	Lastly, we've significantly simplified the WordPress installation by making registration optional and letting you configure ShareThis button options within Wordpress. We encourage you to register with ShareThis to get sharing stats from your site and other new social metrics that we are busy working on.
